# Primitive Weirds and Abundant Numbers

This repository contains datas and programs related to our paper *Primitive abundant and weird numbers with many prime factors*. In a few words, it contains software for generating and counting primitive abundant and weird numbers, give the number of prime factors, counted with their multipliciy (the so-called Î©). 

At the moment everything is in a very rough shape, but it will be improved in the next days.
