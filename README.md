# Primitive Weirds and Abundant Numbers

This repository contains datas and programs related to our paper:

*G. Amato, M. F. Hasler, G. Melfi, M. Parton.<br/>
Primitive abundant and weird numbers with many prime factors.*

In a few words, it contains software for generating and counting primitive abundant and weird numbers, give the number of prime factors, counted with their multipliciy (the so-called Î©).

At the moment everything is in a very rough shape, but it will be improved in the next days.

* `LICENSE`: GPL-3.0 licence which covers the software
* `pans`: counts and lists of primitive abundant numbers
* `weirds`: counts and lists of primitire weirds
* `sage`: software for SageMath
